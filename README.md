# [Weird Spotify](https://weirdspotify.com/)

## Overview

This is a fun website I made that's capable of generating a Spotify playlist based on the user's input.

The names of the songs in the playlist will match the string you enter.

This was my first React project, so please forgive the poor coding practices üòÅ.

## Example

For example, if you entered the string "Hello World it's lovely to see you today," the playlist might look something like this:

- Hello
- World
- It's
- Lovely
- To
- See
- You
- Today
